# While-Loops
This is Module 9 Lab activity problems 1-4, using while loops.

In Problem 1 we create an infinity loop, I do so by having a = 1 and in the while loop say's: while a == 1; thus printing the statemnt "Infinite." You can always remove the infinite loop by commenting it out. 
Next, for problem 2 I create a while loop that incriments by 1 each time through a list and it will keep doing so until it appends to the list, all numbers from 0-10. 
Continueing, with problem 3 this program ask's the user to input a number and it will keep asking to input a 
number and this will repeat in the while loop until we reach above the number 100 and return a False boolean and stop the program.
Finally, in problem 4 is program that has an empty list and in the while loop it will count up to 50 and if the number is divisible by 10 it will append a list of all the numbers that are divisible by 10; thus giving a list of 
10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.
Overall, these problems were an interesting challenge and I was able to comprehend how while loops function!
